## CapsLock Crusader: Unleash Your Keyboard's Hidden Potential! 🦸
Have you ever felt like your keyboard could do more? Of course, you have! Introducing the CapsLock Crusader - the AHK (v1) script that unleashes the hidden potential of your keyboard. No more fumbling with complicated key combos or wrestling with proprietary software from literal hell, just to realize it doesn't support rebinding the FN key.

Arrow keys, F-Row, Volume Settings etc. are often inconveniently placed, requiring unnecessary hand movements. By reducing the need to constantly move your hand away from the home row, you can improve your efficiency and productivity. 

## Features
- 🧙‍♂️ Magic-FN concept without the proprietary sorcery
- 🕹️ WASD turns into arrow keys
- 🎵 Media control shortcuts
- 🔊 Volume adjustment keys
- 🌍 Special characters
- 🚀 Custom function keys

## How it works
While you press the legendary CapsLock key, your keyboard undergoes a transformation:
- WASD ➡️ Arrow keys
- V, C, X ➡️ Media controls
- ], [ ➡️ End, Home
- / ➡️ Delete
- E, Q ➡️ Volume Up, Down
- Escape ➡️ Tilde
- 1-9 ➡️ F1-F9

And that's not all! We've even thrown in some bonus incantations:
