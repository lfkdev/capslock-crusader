## CapsLock Crusader: Unleash Your Keyboard's Hidden Potential! 🦸
Have you ever felt like your keyboard could do more? Of course, you have! Introducing the CapsLock Crusader - the AHK (v1) script that unleashes the hidden potential of your keyboard. No more fumbling with complicated key combos or wrestling with proprietary software from literal hell, just so realize it doesn't support rebinding the FN key. This script is here to save the day!

Arrow keys, F-Row, Volume Settings etc. are often inconveniently placed, requiring unnecessary hand movements. By reducing the need to constantly move your hand away from the home row, you can improve your efficiency and productivity. 

## Features
🧙‍♂️ Magic-FN concept without the proprietary sorcery
🕹️ WASD turns into arrow keys
🎵 Media control shortcuts
🔊 Volume adjustment keys
🌍 Special characters
🚀 Custom function keys

## How it works
While you press the legendary CapsLock key, your keyboard undergoes a transformation:

WASD ➡️ Arrow keys
V, C, X ➡️ Media controls
], [ ➡️ End, Home
/ ➡️ Delete
E, Q ➡️ Volume Up, Down
Escape ➡️ Tilde
1-9 ➡️ F1-F9

And that's not all! We've even thrown in some bonus incantations:

Page Up ➡️ Ctrl + Left Arrow (it's like time travel for your text)
Page Down ➡️ Ctrl + Right Arrow (forward to the future!)
Alt + E ➡️ Euro (€, for when you need to feel a bit continental)
Alt + A ➡️ ä (adding a touch of the exotic)
Alt + O ➡️ ö (another umlaut, because why not?)
Alt + U ➡️ ü (we've got all the umlauts covered!)
Alt + ' ➡️ Backtick (`, it's like an accent mark in hiding)

## Installation
Install AutoHotkey v1 (the secret ingredient)
Save the script above
Double-click the .ahk file to awaken the CapsLock Crusader
(Optional) Add the script to your startup folder to summon the Crusader on every Windows startup

With the CapsLock Crusader at your side, your keyboard will never be the same again! Unshackle your keys and let them soar to new heights! 🧚‍♂️
