## CapsLock Crusader: Unleash Your Keyboard's Hidden Potential! ü¶∏
Have you ever felt like your keyboard could do more? Of course, you have! Introducing the CapsLock Crusader - the AHK (v1) script that unleashes the hidden potential of your keyboard. No more fumbling with complicated key combos or wrestling with proprietary software from literal hell, just to realize it doesn't support rebinding the FN key.

## Why?
This custom keybinding layout offers improved ergonomics and efficiency by optimizing frequently used commands, reducing finger travel, and promoting a comfortable hand position. By utilizing CapsLock as a modifier, essential functions are brought closer to the home row, minimizing the need for awkward key combinations and mitigating the risk of repetitive strain injuries. By consolidating media control, navigation, and volume adjustments into a single modifier layer, users can seamlessly switch between tasks, enhancing productivity and fostering a more intuitive user experience.
